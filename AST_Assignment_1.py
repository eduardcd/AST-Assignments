'''Write a Java program which performs the following tasks:
1. It first inputs an integer between 1 and 100 from the user. Let’s assume the user inputs n.
2. It then reads n more integers and stores them.
3. It computes the sum, the product, the average, the variance, the smallest and the largest
value of these numbers.
4. It outputs, in a nicely formatted way, all the numbers input and the statistics computed.
Note: The output should also be integers, i.e. if the user input three numbers which sum up to
13, the average computed should be 4, not 4.3333...'''

'''Write a program that inputs the diameter of a circle as a number x from the user and outputs
the circumference and the area of the circle.
Then extend your program such that it demonstrates the effect of approximating π, as follows:
• It asks the user to input the maximum precision (number of digits after the period) of π
to be considered.
• Check if this number is reasonable. Otherwise take the maximum reasonable number.
• Approximate by iterating over the the number of digits of precision for π, i.e. in the first
iteration π is approximated by 3, in the second iteration by 3.1, then 3.14, and so forth.
The program should cut off π after the current precision length, not round it!
• Do this until the maximum number of digits of precision is reached, and give the percentage
of increase of the circumference and the area over the previous iteration.'''
